      The idea of Mawaqit was born out of frustration: when we observed how prayer times are managed in our
      mosques for years, see our dads manually adjust old clocks or electronic boards that do not respond
      more to the varied and modern needs of our mosques.
      So we decided with the help of Allah to tackle this frustration and create the service we would have dreamed of. <br>
      Our solution is a WAQF fi sabili Allah and therefore free. The code is open source and accessible on github. <br>
      <span style="color: orange">ANY LUCRATIVE USE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED, PLEASE RESPECT OUR CHOICE.</span>

    concept: |
      Mawaqit offers you a new way to track and manage prayer times, indeed we offer
      an end-to-end system that provides mosque managers with an online tool available 24/24h allowing them
      manage schedules, news and many other features.
      The faithful benefit from a mobile application which allows them to consult the exact timetables
      and not approximate of their favorite mosque, as well as news and other features such as the
      search for mosque by geolocation.
      We have made reliability and quality our main values.
      Our ambition is clear: to build the best service for our mosques through technology and design.
      Any mosque added to our system requires extensive moderation. We suspend any mosque that does not respect our rules
      in order to maintain a reliable service for the community.

    feature1: Display of prayer times in several languages. 2 choices of calculation, automatic or by annual calendar

      A Prophet's Hadith "May Allah's Prayer and Salvation Be to Him" is also displayed every 5 min
    feature4: |
      Communicate with the faithful of your mosque through announcements and flash messages,
      at the mosque and everywhere else on the mobile app
    feature5: Multiple choices of colors, themes and wallpapers
    feature6: City weather display
    feature7: Multiple options, such as turning off the screen during prayer and the jumu`a sermon
    feature8: Control the screen from your computer, smartphone or tablet 24/7
    feature9: A mobile application on iPhone and Android (Find a nearby mosque, route, prayer notification, useful info... etc.)

      <p>
        Well done ! you installed the system image on the memory card of your raspberry, you now have two options:<br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>OPTION 1 (Recommanded): </strong> Use the connected version, it has the following advantages
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Remote control from your smartphone or any computer and tablet</li>
          <li>A synchronized version on all the terminals, mobiles, tablets and screens of the mosque</li>
          <li>Send messages and announcements on the screen from your smartphone or computer</li>
          <li>You benefit from the latest updates automatically without any manipulation</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-left: 2rem">
          <strong>Follow the steps below : </strong>
      </p>
    install7: |
      <ol>
        <li>Start the raspberry and connect an usb keyboard and mouse</li>
        <li>Minimize the mawaqit window with the F11 key on your keyboard</li>
        <li>Connect it to the internet (WIFI or Ethernet cable)</li>
        <li>Synchronize, let yourself be guided on the mawaqit window</li>
        <li>Press F11 key to maximize the mawaqit window</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        NB: At launch, the system checks if an internet connection is available,
        in this case it launches the online version, otherwise it switches to the offline version
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>OPTION 2: </strong>
          Use the offline version, just plug the raspberry on the screen, the software will launch itself.<br>
          <strong>Important :</strong>
          The Raspberry does not have an RTC clock (an electronic component with a battery) which allows
          keeping the time correctly set when it is off.<br>
          So it is advisable to equip the raspberry
          <a href="rtc_link">
              with RTC
          </a>
          if you do not plane to connect it to the internet, this will avoid
          loss of system time in the event of a power failure.
          Just plug it in as illustrated below and type the following command in LXTerminal<br>
          <code>sudo date -s "%now%" && sudo hwclock -w</code> <br><br>
      </p>

  text: |
    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said
    "Whoever does the ablutions perfectly then goes to jumu`a and then listens and is silent,
    he is forgiven what is between that time and the following Friday and three more days
    and the one who touches stones has certainly made a futility"

duaAfterAthan:
  title: Invocation after athan
  text: |
    O Allah, Master of this perfect call and the prayer that we are going to perform, gives Muhammad the power to intercede
    (the Day of Judgment) and the place of honor [in Paradise], and resurrect him in the laudable position that You promised him

duaBetweenAthanAndIqama:
  text: "According to Anas Ibn M√¢lik, the Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: The invocations between Athan and Iq√¢mah are not rejected"
